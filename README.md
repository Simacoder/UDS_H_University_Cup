# **The Entelect Challenge University Cup**

The Entelect Challenge University Cup is a one-day hackathon where teams of students from various universities around the country are challenged to solve a coding problem. The hackathons usually take place from 10:00 to 15:00 on the day.

We have created this unique initiative specifically for students, as we noticed that there is a lot of interest in the main challenge but time commitments can be problematic given academic schedules.

We hope to give our future technology leaders a chance to flex their brain muscles and participate in something fun and rewarding!

**How to Enter**

[Log in/Sign up](https://challenge.entelect.co.za/portal) on the Entelect Challenge player portal.

We will open registration and team creation closer to the hackathon, but start finding friends now to be part of your team.

You will receive alerts via email when team creation opens, when the practice problem is released, and the date/logistics for the University Cup event is announced.

> [!WARNING](Take Note)

The University Cup is open to students registered at a university in South Africa.

This includes undergraduate students as well as full-time Honours students. Unfortunately, if you are working part-time whilst doing your honours, you may not enter the University Cup Challenge.

The University Cup is team-based. Each team must consist of no less than two, and no more than three individuals.

The University Cup will take place over a single Saturday, one in April and one in July. The event will be hosted online for participating University campuses.

> [!TIP]
- Submissions will be done online via the Entelect Challenge player portal.

**Entelect’s Graduate Programme**

Every year, Entelect takes on some of South Africa's brightest young university graduates, who join us with a mix of engineering, science and commerce degrees. These chosen ones participate in an intensive training programme, structured to accelerate their careers – giving them a clear advantage over their university peers.

Would you like to be invited to one of our Graduate Open Days, to learn even more?
